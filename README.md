## Introduction
Command line arguments are parameters provided to a program when it is invoked. These arguments allow users to specify different inputs without modifying the program's source code.

For instance, in the command `ls -l`, `ls` is the program and `-l` is the command line argument that instructs the program to display the files in a long format.

## Reading Command Line Arguments
In C, command line arguments can be read using the `argc` and `argv` parameters of the `main()` function. Here's a brief explanation:

- `argc`: Stands for "argument count". It represents the number of arguments passed to the program, including the program's name.
- `argv`: Stands for "argument vector". It is an array of strings representing the individual arguments provided to the program.

Here's a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# Understanding argz and envz

`argz` and `envz` are interfaces used for argument and environment vector manipulation in C, especially with GNU extensions.

- **argz**: Represents a sequence of strings packed into one allocated block of memory, separated by null bytes (`\0`), and terminated by a double null byte (`\0\0`).

- **envz**: It's similar to `argz` but is used specifically for environment variables.

These interfaces provide a more dynamic way to manipulate command line arguments and environment variables compared to traditional string arrays (`argv` and `envp`). Functions like `argz_add()`, `argz_delete()`, `envz_add()`, and `envz_remove()` allow for easy and dynamic modifications.
